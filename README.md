Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

This app was thoroughly broken down by each milestone in other words weeks that has allowed us to properly manage our time given certain student specific situations. That being said, there were multiple ways to approach this development. I started by using a oencil and paper to map out the design of the application and then moved over to a digital rendering. From there, I began to make any UI action item functional with code and relations. I would say I had some trouble testing and debugging as I would barely have free time after work to being this project and there would not be much focus time which would always cause me to lose track in where I was and what went wrong.
